# Student-Onboarding-Analysis

This project analyzes student onboarding processes using Tableau to uncover trends and actionable insights.

## Key Features
- Visualizes data trends for student onboarding.
- Highlights patterns to improve onboarding efficiency.
- Built with Tableau.

## Files in this Repository
- `Student Onboarding Analysis.twb`: The Tableau workbook containing the analysis.

## How to Use
1. Download the `.twb` file.
2. Open it in Tableau (requires Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader).

## Insights Gained

- **Enrollment Trends**: Enrollment rates peaked in August and September, suggesting a seasonal influx of students. Onboarding efforts can be better timed to accommodate this rush.
  
- **Drop-off Points**: High drop-off rates were observed during the registration phase, indicating a potential need for improvements in this step of the process.

- **Geographical Patterns**: Students from urban areas completed onboarding 20% faster than those from rural regions, suggesting the need for additional support for rural students.

- **Demographic Insights**: First-generation students took longer to complete onboarding, pointing to the need for targeted resources and support during the onboarding process.

- **Interactive vs. Passive Engagement**: Students who engaged with interactive onboarding tutorials reported higher satisfaction levels, suggesting a more engaging approach would improve the experience.

- **Conversion Rates**: Conversion rates from application to enrollment were higher for students who attended information sessions, indicating that pre-onboarding engagement might boost enrollments.

- **Time-to-Completion**: The average time to complete the onboarding process was 4 days, with document submission causing delaysâ€”this step could be optimized for faster processing.

- **Device Usage**: Mobile users experienced delays in completing onboarding compared to desktop users, indicating the platform needs better mobile optimization.
